    "between nominal and ordinal data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature of Categories:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Nominal Data:- Nominal data consists of categories or labels that represent distinct groups or classes with\n",
    "        no inherent order or ranking among them. The categories are mutually exclusive and have no quantitative significance. \n",
    "        Examples of nominal data include colors, types of animals, or gender (male, female, other).\n",

    "        but you cannot determine the exact degree of difference between them. Examples of ordinal data include survey \n",
    "        response options like \"strongly disagree,\" \"disagree,\" \"neutral,\" \"agree,\" and \"strongly agree.\"\n",

    "2. Mathematical Operations:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Nominal Data: Nominal data does not support mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,\n",

    "        but these operations don't make sense in a quantitative sense for nominal data.\n",

    "    -> Ordinal Data:- Ordinal data allows for comparisons of \"greater than\" or \"less than\" based on the order of categories.\n",
    "        However, you cannot perform meaningful arithmetic operations on ordinal data because the intervals between\n",

    "        greater or smaller than another; they are purely nominal.\n",
